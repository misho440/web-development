    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Description</h3>
    <p>The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies. 
	By 2011, the total population was estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a 
	decreasing trend. None of the 'Tiger Conservation Landscapes' within the Bengal tiger's 
	range is considered large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult 
	individuals. Since 2010, it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. </p>
	<p>By 2010, Bengal tiger populations in India were estimated at 1,706&ndash;1,909. As of 2014, 
	they had reputedly increased to an estimated 2,226 individuals, but the method used in the 
	census may not be accurate.</p>
	<p>Bengal tigers number around 440 in Bangladesh and 163&ndash;253 in Nepal. Prior censuses placed 
	the tiger population in Bhutan at around 65&ndash;75 individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that 103 
	Bengal tigers were living in the country.</p>
	<p>Bengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality for the binomen Panthera tigris, to which the 
	British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomen 
	Panthera tigris tigris. The Bengal, Caspian and Siberian tigers, and lion rank among the biggest cats.
	<br />
	It is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Characteristics</h3>
	<p>The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the 
	belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The white 
	tiger is a recessive mutant of the Bengal tiger, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, 
	Bengal, Bihar and especially from the former State of Rewa. However, it is not to be mistaken as an occurrence 
	of albinism. In fact, there is only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger, and none of black tigers, 
	with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846.</p>
	<p>Male Bengal tigers have an average total length of 270 to 310 cm (110 to 120 in) including the tail, while females 
	measure 240 to 265 cm (94 to 104 in) on average. The tail is typically 85 to 110 cm (33 to 43 in) long, and on average, 
	tigers are 90 to 110 cm (35 to 43 in) in height at the shoulders. The weight of males ranges from 180 to 258 kg (397 to 569 lb), 
	while that of the females ranges from 100 to 160 kg (220 to 350 lb). The smallest recorded weights for Bengal tigers are from the 
	Bangladesh Sundarbans, where adult females are 75 to 80 kg (165 to 176 lb). Bengal tigers have exceptionally stout teeth, and 
	the canines are the longest among all living felids; measuring from 7.5 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) in length.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Genetic ancestry</h3>
	<p>Bengal tigers are defined by three distinct mitochondrial nucleotide sites and 12 unique microsatellite alleles. 
	The pattern of genetic variation in the Bengal tiger corresponds to the premise that they arrived in India approximately 1
	2,000 years ago. This is consistent with the lack of tiger fossils from the Indian subcontinent prior to the 
	late Pleistocene and the absence of tigers from Sri Lanka, which was separated from the subcontinent by rising sea 
	levels in the early Holocene.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Body weight</h3>
	<p>Bengal tigers may weigh up to 325 kg (717 lb) and reach a head and body length of 320 cm (130 in). Several 
	scientists indicated that adult male Bengal tigers from Nepal, Bhutan, and Assam, Uttarakhand and West Bengal 
	in northern India (collectively, the tigers of the Terai) consistently attain more than 227 kg (500 lb) of body 
	weight. Seven adult males captured in Chitwan National Park in the early 1970s had an average weight of 235 kg 
	(518 lb) ranging from 200 to 261 kg (441 to 575 lb), and that of the females was 140 kg (310 lb) ranging from 
	116 to 164 kg (256 to 362 lb). &nbsp;Males from northern India are nearly as large as Siberian tigers with a greatest 
	length of skull of 332 to 376 mm (13.1 to 14.8 in).</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Distribution</h3>
	<p>In 1982, a sub-fossil right middle phalanx was found in a prehistoric midden near Kuruwita in Sri Lanka, 
	which is dated to about 16,500 ybp and tentatively considered to be of a tiger. Tigers appear to have arrived 
	in Sri Lanka during a pluvial period, during which sea levels were depressed, evidently prior to the last glacial 
	maximum about 20,000 years ago. In 1929, the British taxonomist Pocock assumed that tigers arrived in southern India 
	too late to colonize Sri Lanka, which earlier had been connected to India by a land bridge.</p>
	<p>Results of a phylogeographic study using 134 samples from tigers across the global range suggest that the 
	historical northeastern distribution limit of the Bengal tiger is the region in the Chittagong Hills and Brahmaputra
	River basin, bordering the historical range of the Indochinese tiger.</p>
	<p>In the Indian subcontinent, tigers inhabit tropical moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests, tropical and 
	subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands. 
	Latter habitat once covered a huge swath of grassland, riverine and moist semi-deciduous forests along the major 
	river system of the Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains, but has now been largely converted to agricultural land or severely 
	degraded. Today, the best examples of this habitat type are limited to a few blocks at the base of the outer foothills of 
	the Himalayas including the Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Rajaji-Corbett, Bardia-Banke, and the transboundary TCUs 
	Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, Dudhwa-Kailali and Shuklaphanta-Kishanpur. Tiger densities in these TCUs are high, in part because 
	of the extraordinary biomass of ungulate prey.</p>
	<p>The Bengal tigers in the Sundarbans in India and Bangladesh are the only tigers in the world inhabiting mangrove forests. 
	The population in the Indian Sundarbans is estimated as 70 tigers in total.</p>

    <p>Tigers have muscular bodies with powerful forelimbs, large heads and 
	long tails. The pelage is dense and heavy; coloration varies between 
	shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive 
	vertical black stripes, whose patterns are unique to each individual. 
	Their function is likely for camouflage in vegetation such as long 
	grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade. The tiger is 
	one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted 
	patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among 
	felids. The tiger's stripes are also found on the skin, so that if 
	it were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be 
	visible. They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck 
	and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The pupils are 
	circular with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent 
	white spot on the back, surrounded by black. These false "eyespots", 
	called ocelli, apparently play an important role in intraspecies communication.
    </p>
	<p>
	The skull is similar to that of the lion, though the frontal region is usually 
	not as depressed or flattened, with a slightly longer postorbital region. 
	The skull of a lion has broader nasal openings. However, due to variation in 
	skulls of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a more reliable 
	indicator of species. The tiger also has fairly stout teeth; the somewhat curved 
	canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in).
	</p>
	<p>
	The oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years. A wild specimen, having no 
	natural predators, could in theory live to a comparable age.

	In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized animals, preferring 
	native ungulates weighing at least 90 kg (200 lb). They typically have little 
	or no deleterious effect on their prey populations. Sambar deer, chital, 
	barasingha, wild boar, gaur, nilgai and both water buffalo and domestic buffalo, 
	in descending order of preference, are the tiger's favoured prey in Tamil Nadu, 
	India, while gaur and sambar are the preferred prey and constitute the main diet 
	of tigers in other parts of India. They also prey on other predators, including dogs, 
	leopards, pythons, sloth bears, and crocodiles. In Siberia, the main prey species are 
	Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species comprising nearly 80% of the prey selected) 
	followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown 
	bears may also fall prey to tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian 
	tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar 
	deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey 
	included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, 
	tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other 
	ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish...

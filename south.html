    <p>The South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is a tiger subspecies that 
	was native to the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi in southern China, 
	and has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996. 
	It is possibly extinct in the wild since no wild individual has been recorded 
	since the early 1970s. Already in the late 1990s, continued survival was considered 
	unlikely due to low prey density, widespread habitat degradation and fragmentation, 
	and other human pressures.</p>
	<p>Since the 1980s, the South China tiger is considered a relict population of the 
	"stem" tiger, living close to the possible area of origin. Morphologically, it is the 
	most distinctive of all tiger subspecies. Results of a phylogeographic study indicate 
	that southern China and northern Indochina was likely the center of the Pleistocene 
	tiger radiation.</p>
	<p>The name Amoy tiger was used in the fur trade. It is also known as the South Chinese, 
	the Chinese, and the Xiamen tiger.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Characteristics</h3>
	<p>In 1905, the German zoologist Max Hilzheimer first described the South China tiger as 
	similar in height to the Bengal tiger, but differing in skull and coat characteristics. 
	Their carnassials and molars are shorter than in his Bengal tiger samples; the cranial 
	region is shorter with orbits set closer together, postorbital processes are larger. 
	Their coat is lighter and more yellowish and the paws, face, and stomach appear more white; 
	the stripes are narrower, more numerous and more sharp-edged.</p>
	<p>The South China tiger is the smallest tiger subspecies from mainland Asia, but bigger 
	than the subspecies known from the Sunda islands such as the Sumatran tiger. Males measure 
	from 230 to 265&nbsp;cm (91 to 104&nbsp;in) between the pegs, and weigh 130 to 175&nbsp;kg (287 to 386&nbsp;lb). 
	Females are smaller and measure 220 to 240&nbsp;cm (87 to 94&nbsp;in) between the pegs, and weigh 110 to 115&nbsp;kg (243 to 254&nbsp;lb). 
	The length of the tail does not usually exceed one half of the head-and-body length. Hair length varies geographically. 
	Greatest length of skull in males is 318 to 343&nbsp;mm (12.5 to 13.5&nbsp;in), and in females 273 to 301&nbsp;mm (10.7 to 11.9&nbsp;in)</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Distribution</h3>
	<p>The skulls described by Hilzheimer originated in Hankou. The historical range of the 
	South China tiger stretched over a vast landscape of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) from east to 
	west and 1,500 km (930 mi) from north to south in China. From the east it ranged from Jiangxi 
	and Zhejiang Provinces at about 120&deg;E westward through Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces at 
	about 100&deg;E. The most northerly extension was in the Qinling Mountain and Yellow River 
	area at approximately 35&deg;N to its southern extension in Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan 
	Provinces at 21&deg;N.</p>

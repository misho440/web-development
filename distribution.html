	In the past, tigers were found throughout Asia, from the Caucasus 
	and the Caspian Sea to Siberia and the Indonesian islands of Java, 
	Bali and Sumatra. Fossil remains indicate tigers were also present 
	in Borneo and Palawan in the Philippines during the late Pleistocene 
	and Holocene.
	</p>
	<p>
	During the 20th century, tigers became extinct in western Asia and were 
	restricted to isolated pockets in the remaining parts of their range. 
	They were extirpated on the island of Bali in the 1940s, around the 
	Caspian Sea in the 1970s, and on Java in the 1980s. This was the result 
	of habitat loss and the ongoing killing of tigers and tiger prey. Today, 
	their fragmented and partly degraded range extends from India in the west 
	to China and Southeast Asia. The northern limit of their range is close to 
	the Amur River in southeastern Siberia. The only large island they still 
	inhabit is Sumatra. Since the beginning of the 20th century, tigers' historical 
	range has shrunk by 93%. In the decade from 1997 to 2007, the estimated area known 
	to be occupied by tigers has declined by 41%.
	</p>
	<p>
	Tigers can occupy a wide range of habitat types, but will usually require sufficient 
	cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger 
	prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and 
	where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with the multiple felines 
	in a pride. A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded den 
	locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation. Bengal 
	tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the 
	semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; 
	the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts 
	of their range they inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially open grassland and savanna 
	as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.

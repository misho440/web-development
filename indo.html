    <p>The Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris corbetti) is a tiger subspecies occurring 
	in Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and southwestern China. It is listed 
	as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population seriously declined in recent years 
	and approaches the threshold for Critically Endangered, with 342 individuals estimated as per 2011.</p>
	<p>The largest population unit survives in Thailand estimated at 189 to 252 individuals. 
	There are 85 individuals in Myanmar and only 20 Indochinese tigers remain in Viet Nam. It is 
	considered extinct in Cambodia.</p>
	<p>The tigers in peninsular Malaysia, formerly classified as Indochinese, have recently been 
	reclassified as a separate subspecies, the Malayan tiger Panthera tigris jacksoni.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Characteristics</h3>
	<p>The Indochinese tiger is generally smaller than Bengal and Siberian tigers. Males range 
	in size from 2.55 to 2.85&nbsp;m (8.4 to 9.4&nbsp;ft) and in weight from 150 to 195&nbsp;kg 
	(331 to 430&nbsp;lb). Females range in size from 2.3 to 2.55&nbsp;m (7.5 to 8.4&nbsp;ft) and in 
	weight from 100 to 130&nbsp;kg (220 to 290&nbsp;lb). These recorded weights are respectively 
	similar to those of male and female Asiatic lions.</p>
	<p>Its head is smaller than of the Bengal tiger; the ground coloration is darker with more 
	rather short and narrow single stripes.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Distribution</h3>
	<p>The Indochinese tiger is distributed in Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. Results of a phylogeographic 
	study using 134 samples from tigers across the global range suggest that the historical northwestern 
	distribution limit of the Indochinese tiger is the region in the Chittagong Hills and Brahmaputra River 
	basin, bordering the historical range of the Bengal tiger. Protected areas in this region include Pakke 
	Tiger Reserve and Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar, presence of tigers was 
	confirmed in the Hukawng Valley, Tamanthi Wildlife Reserve, and in two small areas in the Tanintharyi Region.</p>
	<p>More than half of the total population survives in the Western Forest Complex in Thailand, especially 
	in the area of the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. This habitat consists of tropical and subtropical 
	moist broadleaf forests.</p>
	<p>It has not been recorded in Vietnam since 1997. Available data suggest that there are no more breeding 
	tigers left in Cambodia, Viet Nam and China.</p>
	<p>In China, it occurred historically in the Yunnan province and M&ecirc;dog County in the country's 
	southwestern part, where tigers probably do not survive any more today. One was killed and eaten by five villagers in 2009.</p>
	<p>Indochinese tigers live in forests, grasslands, mountains and hills. They prefer mostly forested 
	habitats such as tropical rainforests, evergreen forests, deciduous forests, tropical and subtropical dry 
	broadleaf forests. Forests provide camouflage, and hunting grounds that fit their lifestyle and dietary needs.</p>

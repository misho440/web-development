	A well-known allele found only in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a color variant first recorded 
	in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: 
	a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the 
	white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter 
	protein SLC45A2.
	</p>
	<p>
	White tigers are more frequently bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool can lead to inbreeding. 
	This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis 
	(curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint).Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live as long 
	as their orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing 
	with other subspecies in the process.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another recessive gene creates the "golden" or "golden tabby" color variation, sometimes known as "strawberry". 
	Golden tigers have thicker than usual light-gold fur, pale legs, and faint orange stripes. Few golden tigers are kept 
	in captivity; they are invariably at least part Bengal. Some golden tigers carry the white tiger gene, and when two such 
	tigers are mated, they can produce some stripeless white offspring. Although a "pseudo-melanistic" effect wide stripes 
	that partially obscure the orange background has been seen in some pelts, no true black tigers have been authenticated, 
	with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846. These wholly or partially melanistic tigers, 
	if they exist, are assumed to be intermittent mutations rather than a distinct species. There are further unconfirmed reports 
	of a "blue" or slate-colored variant, the Maltese tiger. However, while some felids do exhibit this coloration as a solid coat, 
	there is no known genetic configuration that would result in black stripes on a blue-gray background.

	In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized animals, preferring 
	native ungulates weighing at least 90 kg (200 lb). They typically have little 
	or no deleterious effect on their prey populations. Sambar deer, chital, 
	barasingha, wild boar, gaur, nilgai and both water buffalo and domestic buffalo, 
	in descending order of preference, are the tiger's favoured prey in Tamil Nadu, 
	India, while gaur and sambar are the preferred prey and constitute the main diet 
	of tigers in other parts of India. They also prey on other predators, including dogs, 
	leopards, pythons, sloth bears, and crocodiles. In Siberia, the main prey species are 
	Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species comprising nearly 80% of the prey selected) 
	followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown 
	bears may also fall prey to tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian 
	tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar 
	deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey 
	included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, 
	tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other 
	ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.
	</p>
	<p>
	Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but 
	incidents have been reported. More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken. 
	Tigers have been reported attacking and killing elephants ridden by humans during tiger hunts in 
	the nineteenth century. When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such 
	domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys. Old or wounded tigers, unable to catch wild prey, 
	can become man-eaters; this pattern has recurred frequently across India. An exception is in the Sundarbans, 
	where healthy tigers prey upon fishermen and villagers in search of forest produce, humans thereby forming a 
	minor part of the tiger's diet. Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation 
	for dietary fibre. The fruit of the slow match tree is a favorite.
	</p>
	<p>
	Tigers are thought to be mainly nocturnal predators, but in areas where humans are typically absent, they 
	have been observed via remote-controlled, hidden cameras, hunting in daylight. They generally hunt alone and 
	ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to 
	knock the prey off balance. Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, 
	knock it over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth. Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about 
	49 to 65 km/h (30 to 40 mph) but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover.
	If the prey catches wind of the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey 
	or battle it head-on. Horizontal leaps of up to 10 m (33 ft) have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance 
	are more typical. One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill.
	</p>
	<p>
	When hunting larger animals, tigers prefer to bite the throat and use their powerful forelimbs to hold onto the prey, 
	often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. 
	By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although 
	they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can 
	be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator 
	routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have 
	reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them. With smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares,
	the tiger bites the nape, often breaking the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery. 
	Though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash 
	the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of sloth bears.
	</p>
	<h3>Interaction with other predators</h3>
	<p>
	Tigers usually prefer to eat prey they have caught themselves, but are not above eating carrion in times of scarcity and 
	may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under 
	dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts 
	may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons and crocodiles on occasion. 
	Tigers may also prey on these competitors. Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost 
	certainly predatory. Crocodiles, bears and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and in some cases even kill them.
	</p>
	<p>
	The considerably smaller leopard avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day and hunting different prey.
	In India's Nagarhole National Park, most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to 175 kg (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for 
	prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers. The average prey weight in the two respective big cats in India was 37.6 kg (83 lb) 
	against 91.5 kg (202 lb). With relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive 
	exclusion or interspecies dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the African savanna (where the leopard may 
	coexist with the lion). Lone golden jackals expelled from their pack have been known to form commensal relationships with tigers. 
	These solitary jackals, known as kol-bahl, will attach themselves to a particular tiger, trailing it at a safe distance to feed 
	on the big cat's kills.

	<h3>Reproduction</h3>

	<p>
	Mating can occur all year round, but is more common between November and April. A female is only receptive for three to six days. 
	Mating is frequent and noisy during that time. Gestation can range from 93 to 112 days, the average being 105 days. The litter is 
	usually two or three cubs, occasionally as few as one or as many as six. Cubs weigh from 680 to 1,400 g (1.50 to 3.09 lb) each at birth, 
	and are born blind and helpless. The females rear them alone, with the birth site and maternal den in a sheltered location such as a 
	thicket, cave or rocky crevice. The father generally takes no part in rearing them. Unrelated wandering male tigers may kill cubs to 
	make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are 
	lost. The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% in the first two years. Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence 
	and ferocity of the mother tiger. Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and 
	accidents.
	</p>
	<p>
	A dominant cub emerges in most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings and takes the lead in their play,
	eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, 
	the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until 
	they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around the time they are weaned, they start to accompany their mother on 
	territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. 
	The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to two and a half years old that they 
	fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.

    <p>The Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), also called Amur tiger is a tiger subspecies 
	inhabiting mainly the Sikhote Alin mountain region with a small population in southwest Primorye 
	Province in the Russian Far East. The Siberian tiger once ranged throughout all of Korea, north-eastern 
	China, Russian Far East, and eastern Mongolia. In 2005, there were 331&ndash;393 adult and subadult Siberian 
	tigers in this region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The population had been stable 
	for more than a decade due to intensive conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that 
	the Russian tiger population was declining. By 2015, the Siberian tiger population had increased to 480&ndash;540 
	individuals in the Russian Far East, including 100 cubs. A more detailed census revealed a total population of 562 
	wild Siberian tigers in Russia.</p>
	<p>This tiger subspecies was also called Korean tiger, Manchurian tiger, and Ussurian tiger, depending on the region 
	where individuals were observed.</p>
	<p>The Siberian tiger and Bengal tiger subspecies rank among the biggest living cats. An average adult male Siberian 
	outweighs an average adult male lion by around 45.5 kg (100 lb). A comparison of data on body weights of Siberian 
	tigers indicates that up to the first half of the 20th century both males and females were on average heavier 
	than post-1970 ones. Today's wild Siberian tigers are smaller than Bengal tigers. Their reduced weight as compared 
	to historical Siberian tigers may be due to a combination of causes: when captured, they were usually sick or injured 
	and involved in a conflict situation with people.</p>
	<p>Results of a phylogeographic study comparing mitochondrial DNA from Caspian tigers and living tiger subspecies 
	indicate that the common ancestor of the Amur and Caspian subspecies colonized Central Asia from eastern China via 
	the Gansu&minus;Silk Road corridor from eastern China, and then subsequently traversed Siberia eastward to establish 
	the Amur tiger population in the Russian Far East.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Characteristics</h3>
	<p>The Siberian tiger is reddish-rusty, or rusty-yellow in color, with narrow black 
	transverse stripes. The body length is not less than 150 cm (60 in), condylobasal length 
	of skull 250 mm (10 in), zygomatic width 180 mm (7 in), and length of upper carnassial tooth 
	over 26 mm (1 in) long. It has an extended supple body standing on rather short legs with a 
	fairly long tail. It is typically 5&ndash;10 cm (2&ndash;4 in) taller than the Bengal tiger, which is 
	about 107&ndash;110 cm (42&ndash;43 in) tall.</p>
	<p>The largest male, with largely assured references, measured 350 cm (140 in) "over the curves", 
	equivalent to 330 cm (130 in) "between the pegs". The tail length in fully grown males is about 1 m (39 in). 
	Weights of up to 318 kg (701 lb) have been recorded and exceptionally large males weighing up to 384 kg (847 lb) 
	are mentioned, but no such cases are confirmed. Maz&aacute;k indicates the typical weight range of Siberian tigers 
	as 180&ndash;306 kg (397&ndash;675 lb) for males and 100&ndash;167 kg (220&ndash;368 lb) for females.</p>
	<p>Exceptionally large individuals were targeted and shot by hunters. An unconfirmed report tells of a male 
	tiger shot in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains in 1950 weighing 384 kg (847 lb) with an estimated length of 3.48 m (11.4 ft). 
	In some cases, captive Siberian tigers reached a body weight of up to 465 kg (1,025 lb), such as the tiger "Jaipur."</p>
	<p>Measurements taken by scientists of the Siberian Tiger Project in Sikhote-Alin range from 200&ndash;450 cm (79&ndash;177 in) 
	in head and body length measured in straight line, with an average of 195 cm (77 in) for males; and for females ranging from 
	167 to 182 cm (66 to 72 in) with an average of 174 cm (69 in). The average tail measures 99 cm (39 in) in males and 91 cm 
	(36 in) in females. The longest male measured 309 cm (122 in) in total length (tail of 101 cm (40 in)) and had a chest girth 
	of 127 cm (50 in). The longest female measured 270 cm (110 in) in total length (tail of 88 cm (35 in)) and had a chest girth 
	of 108 cm (43 in). These measurements show that the present Amur tiger is generally longer than the Bengal tiger and 
	the African lion.</p>
	
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Fur and coat</h3>
	<p>The ground colour of Siberian tigers' pelage is often very pale, especially in winter coat. 
	However, variations within populations may be considerable. Individual variation is also found 
	in form, length, and partly in colour, of the dark stripes, which have been described as being 
	dark brown rather than black.</p>
	<p>The fur of the Siberian tiger is moderately thick, coarse and sparse compared to that of other 
	felids living in the former Soviet Union. Compared to the now-extinct westernmost populations, 
	the Far Eastern Siberian tiger's summer and winter coats contrast sharply with other subspecies. 
	Generally, the coat of western populations was brighter and more uniform than that of the Far 
	Eastern populations. The summer coat is coarse, while the winter coat is denser, longer, softer, 
	and silkier. The winter fur often appears quite shaggy on the trunk, and is markedly longer on 
	the head, almost covering the ears. The whiskers and hair on the back of the head and the top 
	of the neck are also greatly elongated. The background color of the winter coat is generally less 
	bright and rusty compared to that of the summer coat. Due to the winter fur's greater length, the 
	stripes appear broader with less defined outlines. The summer fur on the back is 15&ndash;17&nbsp;mm 
	(0.59&ndash;0.67&nbsp;in) long, 30&ndash;50&nbsp;mm (1.2&ndash;2.0&nbsp;in) along the top of the neck, 
	25&ndash;35&nbsp;mm (0.98&ndash;1.38&nbsp;in) on the abdomen, and 14&ndash;16&nbsp;mm (0.55&ndash;0.63&nbsp;in) 
	on the tail. The winter fur on the back is 40&ndash;50&nbsp;mm (1.6&ndash;2.0&nbsp;in), 70&ndash;110&nbsp;mm 
	(2.8&ndash;4.3&nbsp;in) on the top of the neck, 70&ndash;95&nbsp;mm (2.8&ndash;3.7&nbsp;in) on the throat, 
	60&ndash;100&nbsp;mm (2.4&ndash;3.9&nbsp;in) on the chest and 65&ndash;105&nbsp;mm (2.6&ndash;4.1&nbsp;in) 
	on the abdomen. The whiskers are 90&ndash;115&nbsp;mm (3.5&ndash;4.5&nbsp;in).</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Distribution</h3>
	<p>The Siberian tiger once inhabited much of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria and other parts of north-eastern 
	China, the eastern part of Siberia and the Russian Far East, perhaps as far west as Mongolia and the area of 
	Lake Baikal, where the Caspian tiger also reportedly occurred. The geographical range of Siberian tiger in the 
	Russian Far East stretches south to north for almost 1,000&nbsp;km (620&nbsp;mi) the length of Primorsky Krai 
	and into southern Khabarovsk Krai east and south of the Amur River. It also occurs within the Greater Xing'an 
	Range, which crosses into Russia from China at several places in southwest Primorye. In both regions, peaks are 
	generally 500 to 800&nbsp;m (1,600 to 2,600&nbsp;ft) above sea level, with only a few reaching 1,000&nbsp;m (3,300&nbsp;ft) 
	or more. This region represents a merger zone of two bioregions: the East Asian coniferous-deciduous complex and the northern 
	boreal complex, resulting in a mosaic of forest types that vary with elevation, topography, and history. Key habitats 
	of the Siberian tiger are Korean pine broadleaf forests with a complex composition and structure.</p>
	<p>The faunal complex of the region is represented by a mixture of Asian and boreal life forms. The ungulate 
	complex is represented by seven species, with Manchurian wapiti, Siberian roe deer, and wild boar being the most 
	common throughout the Sikhote-Alin mountains but rare in higher altitude spruce-fir forests. Sika deer are restricted 
	to the southern half of the Sikhote-Alin mountains. Siberian musk deer and Amur moose are associated with the conifer 
	forests and are near the southern limits of their distribution in the central Sikhote-Alin mountains.</p>
	<p>The number of Amur tigers in China is estimated at 18&ndash;22. In 2005, there were 331&ndash;393 Amur tigers in 
	the Russian Far East, comprising a breeding adult population of about 250, fewer than 100 likely to be sub-adults, 
	more than 20 likely to be less than 3 years of age. More than 90% of the population occurs in the Sikhote Alin mountain region.</p>
	<p>An unknown number of tigers survive in the reserve areas around Baekdu Mountain, based on tracks and sightings.</p>
	<p>In April 2014, World Wide Fund for Nature personnel captured a video of a Siberian tigress with cubs in inland China.</p>
	<p>In December 2015, Siberian tigers have been spotted in the Jilin Province of north-eastern China, a sign for expansion 
	of Siberian tiger range in inland China. It is estimated that 27 Siberian tigers live in Jilin Province.</p>

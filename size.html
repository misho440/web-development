	Tigers are the most variable in size of all big cats, much more so than lions. 
	The Bengal and Siberian subspecies are the tallest at the shoulder and thus considered 
	the largest living felids, ranking with the extinct Caspian tiger among the biggest that 
	ever existed. An average adult male tiger from Northern India or Siberia outweighs an average
	adult male lion by around 45.5 kg (100 lb). Males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm 
	(98 to 154 in) and weigh between 90 to 306 kg (198 to 675 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 
	to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in). Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (79 to 108 in), weigh 
	65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 mm (10.6 to 12.5 in). 
	In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of total length.
	</p>
	<p>
	Body size of different populations seems to be correlated with climate Bergmann's rule and can be 
	explained by thermoregulation. Large male Siberian tigers can reach a total length of more than 3.5 m 
	(11.5 ft) over curves and 3.3 m (10.8 ft) between pegs, and can weigh up to 306 kg (675 lb). This is 
	considerably larger than the weight of 75 to 140 kg (165 to 309 lb) reached by the smallest living subspecies, 
	the Sumatran tiger. At the shoulder, tigers may variously stand 0.7 to 1.22 m (2.3 to 4.0 ft) tall. The current 
	record weight in the wild was 389 kg (858 lb) for a Bengal tiger shot in 1967.
	</p>
	<p>
	They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being consistently smaller than males. The size difference 
	between males and females is proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 
	times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.

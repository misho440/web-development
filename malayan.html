    <p>The Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) is a tiger subspecies that inhabits 
	the southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula and has been classified as 
	Critically Endangered by IUCN in 2015 as the population was roughly estimated at 250 
	to 340 adult individuals in 2013; this population likely comprises less than 250 
	mature breeding individuals, with a declining trend.</p>
	<p>When in 1968 Panthera tigris corbetti was newly designated, the tigers inhabiting 
	the Malayan Peninsula were included into this subspecies. In 2004, Panthera tigris 
	jacksoni was recognised as a new subspecies when a genetic analysis found that they 
	are distinct in mtDNA and micro-satellite sequences from Panthera tigris corbetti.</p>
	<p>In Malay language the tiger is called harimau, also abbreviated to rimau.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Characteristics</h3>
	<p>There is no clear difference between the Malayan and the Indochinese tiger when 
	specimens from the two regions are compared cranially or in pelage. 
	No type specimen was designated.</p>
	<p>Malayan tigers appear to be smaller than Indian ones. From measurements of 11 
	males and 8 females, the average length of a male is 8&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in (259&nbsp;cm),
	and of a female 7&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in (239&nbsp;cm).</p>
	<p>Body length taken from 16 female tigers in the State of Terengganu ranged from 70 to 
	103&nbsp;in (180 to 260&nbsp;cm) and averaged 80.1&nbsp;in (203&nbsp;cm). Their height 
	ranged from 23 to 41&nbsp;in (58 to 104&nbsp;cm), and their body weight from 52 to 195&nbsp;lb 
	(24 to 88&nbsp;kg). Data from 21 males in the State of Terengganu showed that total length ranged 
	from 75 to 112&nbsp;in (190 to 280&nbsp;cm), with an average of 94.2&nbsp;in (239&nbsp;cm). 
	Their height ranged from 24 to 45&nbsp;in (61 to 114&nbsp;cm), and their body weight from 104 to 
	284.7&nbsp;lb (47.2 to 129.1&nbsp;kg).</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Distribution</h3>
	<p>The geographic division between Malayan and Indochinese tigers is unclear as tiger populations 
	in northern Malaysia are contiguous with those in southern Thailand. In Singapore tigers were 
	extirpated in the 1950s, and the last one shot in 1932.</p>
	<p>Between 1991 and 2003, tiger signs were reported from early-succession vegetation fields, 
	agricultural areas outside forests in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor, and many riparian 
	habitats outside forests in Pahang, Perak, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Johor. Most of the major rivers 
	that drain into the South China Sea had some evidence of tigers, whereas those draining into the 
	Straits of Malacca in the west did not.</p>
	<p>Tiger signs were not reported from Perlis, Penang, and Malacca, and the federal territories of 
	Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya in the west coast. The total potential tiger habitat was 66,211&nbsp;km2 
	(25,564&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), which comprised 37,674&nbsp;km2 (14,546&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of confirmed tiger 
	habitat, 11,655&nbsp;km2 (4,500&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of expected tiger habitat and 16,882&nbsp;km2 
	(6,518&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of possible tiger habitat. All the protected areas greater than 402&nbsp;km2 
	(155&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in size had tigers.</p>
	<p>In September 2014 two conservation organisations announced that a camera trap survey of seven 
	sites in the three separate habitats from 2010 to 2013 had produced an estimate of the surviving 
	population from 250 to 340 healthy individuals, with a few additional isolated small pockets probable. 
	According to the report, the decline meant that the species might have to be moved to the "Critically 
	Endangered" category in the IUCN list.</p>

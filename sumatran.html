    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Description</h3>
    <p>The Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) is a rare tiger subspecies that inhabits 
	the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN 
	Red List in 2008 as the population was estimated at 441 to 679 individuals, with no 
	subpopulation larger than 50 individuals and a declining trend.</p>
	<p>The Sumatran tiger is the only surviving member of the Sunda Islands group of tigers 
	that included the now extinct Bali tiger and Javan tiger. Sequences from complete mitochondrial 
	genes of 34 tigers support the hypothesis that Sumatran tigers are diagnostically distinct 
	from mainland populations.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Characteristics</h3>
	<p>Pocock first described the Sumatran tiger on the basis of several skull, pelage, and 
	striping features in which it is distinct from the Indian and Javan tigers. It is darker in 
	fur colour and has thicker stripes than the Javan tiger. Stripes tend to disintegrate into 
	spots near their ends, and lines of small, dark specks between regular stripes may be found 
	on the back, flanks, and hind legs. The frequency of stripes is higher than in other subspecies.</p>
	<p>Males have a prominent ruff, which is especially marked in the Sumatran tiger.</p>
	<p>The Sumatran tiger is one of the smallest tiger subspecies. Males weigh 100 to 140&nbsp;kg (220 to 310&nbsp;lb) 
	and measure 2.2 to 2.55&nbsp;m (87 to 100&nbsp;in) in length between the pegs with a greatest length of skull of 
	295 to 335&nbsp;mm (11.6 to 13.2&nbsp;in). Females weigh 75 to 110&nbsp;kg (165 to 243&nbsp;lb) and measure 215 
	to 230&nbsp;cm (85 to 91&nbsp;in) in length between the pegs with a greatest length of skull of 263 to 294&nbsp;mm (10.4 to 11.6&nbsp;in).</p>
	<p>Charles Frederick Partington (1835) said that Sumatran and Javan tigers were strong enough 
	to break legs of horses or buffaloes with their paws, though they were not as heavy as Bengal tigers.</p>
	
	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Distribution</h3>
	<p>Sumatran tigers persist in isolated populations across Sumatra. They occupy a wide array of habitats, ranging 
	from sea level in the coastal lowland forest of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on the southeastern tip of 
	Lampung Province to 3,200&nbsp;m (10,500&nbsp;ft) in mountain forests of Gunung Leuser National Park in Aceh Province. 
	They have been repeatedly photographed at 2,600&nbsp;m (8,500&nbsp;ft) in a rugged region of northern Sumatra, and are 
	present in 27 habitat patches larger than 250&nbsp;km2 (97&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).</p>
	<p>In 1978, the Sumatran tiger population was estimated at 1,000 individuals, based on responses to a questionnaire survey. 
	In 1985, a total of 26 protected areas across Sumatra containing about 800 tigers were identified. In 1992, an estimated 400&ndash;500 
	tigers lived in five national parks and two protected areas.</p>
	<p>At that time, the largest population, comprising 110-180 individuals, was reported from the Gunung Leuser National Park. 
	However, a more recent study shows that the Kerinci Seblat National Park in central Sumatra has the highest population of tigers on the 
	island, estimated to be 165&ndash;190 individuals. The park also was shown to have the highest tiger occupancy rate of the protected areas, 
	with 83% of the park showing signs of tigers. More tigers are in the Kerinci Seblat National Park than in all of Nepal, and more than in China,
	Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam combined.</p>

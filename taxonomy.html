    <p>
	In 1758, Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae 
	and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris. In 1929, the British 
	taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the 
	genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris.
	The word Panthera is probably of Oriental origin and retraceable to 
	the Ancient Greek word panther, the Latin word panthera, the Old French 
	word pantere, most likely meaning "the yellowish animal", or from pandarah 
	meaning whitish-yellow. The derivation from Greek pan- ("all") and ther 
	("beast") may be folk etymology.
	</p>
	<p>
	The specific epithet, tigris, as well as the common name, tiger, come from 
	the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both 
	used for the animal. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself a derivative 
	of the Latin word tigris and the Greek word tigris. The original source may have 
	been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an 
	arrow, perhaps referring to the speed with which a tiger launches itself at its prey.
	</p>
	<p>
	The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the lion, leopard 
	and jaguar, all of which are classified under the genus Panthera. Genetic analysis 
	indicates that the tiger and the snow leopard diverged from the other Panthera species 
	about 2.88 million years ago, and that both species may be more closely related to each 
	other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.
	</p>
	<p>
	The oldest remains of an extinct tiger relative, called Panthera zdanskyi or the Longdan 
	tiger, have been found in the Gansu province of northwestern China. This species is considered 
	to be a sister taxon to the extant tiger and lived about 2 million years ago, at the beginning 
	of the Pleistocene. It was smaller than the modern tiger, being the size of a jaguar, and probably 
	did not have the same coat pattern. Despite being considered more "primitive", the Longdan tiger 
	was functionally and possibly ecologically similar to its modern cousin. As Panthera zdanskyi 
	lived in northwestern China, that may have been where the tiger lineage originated. Tigers grew 
	in size, possibly in response to adaptive radiations of prey species like deer and bovids which may 
	have occurred in Southeast Asia during the early Pleistocene.
	</p>
	<p>
	The earliest fossils of true tigers are from Java, and are between 1.6 and 1.8 million years old. 
	Distinct fossils are known from the early and middle Pleistocene deposits in China and Sumatra. 
	A subspecies called the Trinil tiger (Panthera tigris trinilensis) lived about 1.2 million years 
	ago and is known from fossils found at Trinil in Java.
	</p>
	<p>
	Tigers first reached India and northern Asia in the late Pleistocene, reaching eastern Beringia 
	(but not the American Continent), Japan, and Sakhalin. Fossils found in Japan indicate the local 
	tigers were, like the surviving island subspecies, smaller than the mainland forms, an example of 
	insular dwarfism. Until the Holocene, tigers also lived in Borneo, as well as on the island of Palawan 
	in the Philippines.
	</p>
	<p>
	The tiger's full genome sequence was published in 2013. It and other cat genomes were found to have similar 
	repeat composition and an appreciably conserved synteny.
